# ComfyUI-Easy-Use-Frontend

New Front-end of [ComfyUI-Easy-Use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use) custom nodes. This repo will replace the original web_extension in future releases.
<br>It cannot be used in older versions of Comfy because it uses a new API.

## Road Map

### What has been done

- Beautify the right-click menu and allow custom nodes to be sorted A-Z.
- Added some shortcut keys (e.g: Align nodes in selection, Shift key and click the center point of the connection to convert it to get set nodes).
- Chain get node and set node with parent nodes. Credit by [ComfyUI-mape-Helpers](https://github.com/mape/ComfyUI-mape-Helpers)
- Added statistics time in node.
- Re-designed the node of the `easy stylesSelector`

### What to be done

- Re-design Group Map
- Add settings to manage the shortcut keys and some other settings. (If the official Keybinding settings management is added it may be adjusted accordingly.)
- More features...
