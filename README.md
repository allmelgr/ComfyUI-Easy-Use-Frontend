# ComfyUI-Easy-Use-Frontend

New Front-end of [ComfyUI-Easy-Use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use) custom nodes. This repo will replace the original web_extension in future releases.
<br>It cannot be used in older versions of Comfy because it uses a new API.

## Some Explanation

#### why not use typescript?
- It requires a lot of extra work for me. I donâ€™t think a strongly typed language will bring me any benefits. Easyuse is just a custom nodes package and does not need to maintain as many functions as the main repository.

## Road Map

### What has been done

- Beautify the right-click menu and allow custom nodes to be sorted A-Z.
- Added some shortcut keys (e.g: Align nodes in selection, Shift key and click the center point of the connection to convert it to get set nodes).
- Chain get node and set node with parent nodes. Credit by [ComfyUI-mape-Helpers](https://github.com/mape/ComfyUI-mape-Helpers)
- Added statistics time in node.
- Re-designed the node of the `easy stylesSelector`
- Add settings to manage the shortcut keys and some other settings. (If the official Keybinding settings management is added it may be adjusted accordingly.)


### What to be done

- Re-design Group Map
- More features...

## Development

git clone https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use-Frontend
```
### 2.Install dependencies
```bash
cd ComfyUI-Easy-Use-Frontend
npm install
```
### 3.Build the code
- It will watch for code changes and build the `easyuse.js` into the `../web_version/dev/` folder.
```bash
npm run build:dev 
```
### 4. Modify the `config.yaml` file located in the root directory of the ComfyUI-Easy-Use project.
